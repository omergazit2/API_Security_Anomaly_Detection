# API Security: Anomaly Detection App


## Dataset

This project uses the **API Access Behaviour Anomaly Dataset**, publicly available on Kaggle.

* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tangodelta/api-access-behaviour-anomaly-dataset/data)
* **License:** GPL-2

The dataset contains user access metrics and API call graphs from distributed micro-service applications. It includes a labeled set of access patterns (intended for training) and an unlabeled set for classification, with the goal of identifying API abuse and business logic exploits.


## Objectives

The Main objective of this project is to develop a system that will be able to detect anomaly behaviour from the API calls for the remaining requences. 

To acchive this objective, it was further broken down into the following technical sub-objectives:
